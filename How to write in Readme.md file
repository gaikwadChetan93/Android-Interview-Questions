1.Italic
To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.

2.Bold
Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really** get your point across.

3.Header
To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#).
You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example,
for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (# Header One), while for a header three, you'd use three (### Header Three).

4.Link

There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way.
The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ),
and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ).
For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, 
you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).

5.Reference Link
As the name implies, the link is actually a reference to another place in the document.
